# Universal Update Tool

- Point it to any public gh release asset
- Easily update it any time

---

### Add a program

1. Add a repokey (the user followed by the repositiory) e.g. `lspaccatrosi16/scaffold`

2. Add the artifact name (what it will be called in every release).

3. Optionally add a different binary name (this is what the file will actually be saved as)

4. Add `~/.config/aup` to path (all the binaries get saved there)
